## Overview

### Description

I want a small corner of the internet that I can call my own, this is that place. Previously I already had a personal website, but decided it was due for an upgrade, hence comes this new version v2.

### Goals

1. Update the design from v1 to something more personalized
2. Provide information about myself & my coding journey
3. Display the work I am most proud of in my project section
4. Have a contact form for people to message me

### Inspiration

- [Brittany Chiang](https://brittanychiang.com/) - *The design of the website is so nice and clean ... and I love the colour scheme! Also the little teleporter phone booth in the bottom right is such a cool idea, and what inspired me to create a v2 of my own website.*

    description: `I got into coding because I was the web designer for a company I founded called Koji Street. While working with a development team to bring the idea to life, I became interested in the coding aspect of things. I taught myself to code using free online resources and immediately loved the creativity and problem solving required to succeed in web development. I began by learning HTML & CSS, moving onward to JavaScript and then expanding my knowledge base to include JavaScript frameworks like React, Next.js, a bit of backend programming, blockchain development and more.`,

    description: `I have always had a deep entrepreneurial drive. I love building things and solving problems. After university I started my own business called Koji Street, a marketplace for original art & fashion. During my two years of running the venture I learned so many essential skills such as teamwork, planning, talking with users, getting critical feedback, web design, and much more. Although I am not running Koji Street anymore today, the same entrepreneurial spirit drives me in all of my projects.`,

    description: `I have always been curious. I find great interest in exploring how everything works together. In whatever I am working on, it is important to me to build an understanding of the big picture, which I call 'getting to the source'. I find that the better I am able to understand this, not only do I become more productive and successful, but I am much more motivated because I can see and understand the results of my work. `,
